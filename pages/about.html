        <div class="main-content">
            <p> My experience in tech has been a long one. I graduated with a graphic design degree in 2007. At wich
                point I
                went to work in a printing company, but not as a graphic designer on the count that I didn't have the
                experience. So I did print layout and setup. I worked on the computer and I knew all the programs we
                were
                using
                but didn't have the confidence to express my understanding and knowledge or my willingness to learn a
                higher
                position. I felt ostersised most times when I did speak up to my manager to improve upon a process or
                spoken
                down to. In 2009 I had my first daughter and became the primary caretaker of my 2 nephews the younger of
                which
                was already
                struggling in and out of group homes. My partner and I was trying to provide stability for the boys and
                navigate
                learning to be new parents all at once. After a year I left my job and opted for temp work to have a
                more
                flexible schedule while my partner finished his degree and took on a no pay intern-ship. At this point
                we
                took
                custody of my 2 nieces as well and my younger nephew ended up being taken to a juvinile facility. My
                youngest
                niece was born with a congenital heart defect and we found that she needed open heart surgery and alot
                of
                medical care. After a year my oldest nephew was 16 going on 17 and decided to drop out of high school,
                against
                our
                wishes for him, and take
                what ever work
                he could get to try to help with the house hold. It became increasingly harder to maintain a work
                schedule, doctors appointments and care for her health needs, as well as care for the other children at
                home
                at
                that
                time. We were
                very fortunate that my partners internship led to a full time position. I became a stay at home mom and
                we
                lived
                very humbly. My niece has gone on to have 1 more open heart surgery before she went into heart failure
                and
                had
                to be placed on the
                transplant list early 2013 by the grace of all she recieved her transplant on May 9 2013. It was a 2
                year
                recovery process at which point other health concerns kept coming up till we finally reached a point of
                stability,
                we thought. But life doesn't always go how you hope for it to. Early 2015 my niece caught a virus that
                landed
                her in the hospital. She had to have 3 blood transfusion wich I provided, thankfully we are the same
                blood
                type.
                I also had a baby girl in April that year.
                Then she went on to fight this virus with monthly IV infusions for almost 2 years. Constant ups and
                downs
                she
                contracted "A" septic meningitis. My youngest daughter caught pnemonia at 10.5 months that turned out to
                be
                MRSA
                pnemonia. Her left lung callapsed and she has scaring in her lung from it. It took 6 months for her to
                be
                clear
                of
                the infection and we get told again and again how lucky we are. And through it all or maybe despite it
                all
                we
                tried
                our best to
                maintain a stable and happy
                household. My daughter finally stabalized again and was clear of the virus enough to no longer need IV
                injections.
                Only to find out that she had a
                bout of rejection in 2020 at the same time the pandemic was starting. She also had to
                have a full spinal fusion in 2021 due to poor muscle mass as a byproduct of all her health problems. We
                got
                through it all, and a year later she is clear
                of rejection with minor cellular damage that will need to be watched but we will take it. She has to
                have a
                biopsy
                yearly to check for anymore rejection or new bouts of rejection but we do what needs to be done. I was
                out
                of
                work
                for all of it and I feel blessed that I was able to be there for my kids. I now
                realized that I have to figure out where I am going and what I am going to do. My boys are both in their
                20s
                and
                my
                oldest daughter is 18, my
                second oldest will be 17 late summer, my second to youngest will be 13 mid-summer and my youngest will
                be 7
                in
                early April. 4 of my children may have started out as my nephews & nieces but
                through all the hardships, tears and laughter we have a bond that is deep and unbreakable. I decided
                that I
                want
                to
                be the role
                model I
                never had growing up for them, my kids. I want them to know its never to late to start and its never to
                late
                to
                dream. And if you keep dreaming before you know it your dreams have become your life.
                While coming to this relization my partner came across Tech-Moms and I knew this is where I needed to
                be.
                This
                is
                where I can take that step forward and start a new part of my journey.</p>
