            <h1>Hello I am La Toya</h1>
            <h3>I'm a Mom and I strive to Achieve many Things!</h3>
            <p> My experience in tech has been a long one. <br>
                I had some computer training in highschool such as microfoft office and excel.
                I went on to grauate college with a graphic design degree. Then went to work at a printing company.
                But due to lack of experience I was doing basic print layouts, setups and plate setting.
                I worked on the computer and I knew all the programs we were using
                but didn't have the confidence to express my understanding and knowledge or my willingness to learn a
                higher position.
                I felt ostersised most times when I did speak up to my manager to improve upon a process or
                spoken down to. <br>
                I was a caretaker to my 2 nephews and had my first child in 2009. After workign there 2 years I left
                that job and
                began working temp jobs for a more flexible schedule. I got custody of my 2 nieces as well.
                My youngest niece was born with a heart condition and many other health problems requiring
                alot of care.<br>
                My partner at this time was finishing an unpaid internship and was able to get full time work in his
                field. I quite working to care full time for our kids. We lived humbly but comfortably.<br>
                I was a stay at home mom for going on 11 years. In that time my youngest niece had
                a heartransplant in May 2013. I also had another daughter in April 2015. We had alot of
                ups and downs, good and not so great but we got throuhg it all.<br>
                My boys are both in their 20s now and my oldest daughter is 18, my second oldest daughter will be 17
                late summer,
                my second to youngest daughter will be 13 mid-summer and my youngest will be 7 in
                early April. 4 of my children may have started out as my nephews & nieces but
                through all the hardships, tears and laughter we have a bond that is deep and unbreakable.
                I now realize that I have to figure out where I am going and what I am going to do.
                I decided that I want to be the role model I never had growing up for them.
                I want them to know its never to late to start and its never to late to dream.
                And if you keep dreaming before you know it your dreams have become your reality.
                While coming to this relization my partner came across Tech-Moms and I knew this is where I needed to
                be.
                This is where I can take that step forward and start a new part of my journey.</p>
